     #Let's call GenMatch() to find the optimal weight to give each
     #covariate in 'X' so as we have achieved balance on the covariates in
     #'BalanceMat'. This is only an example so we want GenMatch to be quick
     #so the population size has been set to be only 16 via the 'pop.size'
     #option. This is *WAY* too small for actual problems.
